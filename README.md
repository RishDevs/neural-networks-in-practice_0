Here’s a clean, human-sounding, portfolio-safe README you can drop straight into your repo and tweak with your name/links if needed.

It explains what the project is, shows maturity, and includes an academic-integrity note 👇

🧠 Applied Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repository contains my work for a graduate-level deep learning assignment focused on building end-to-end machine learning and neural network pipelines using PyTorch.

The project moves from data analysis and classical ML models all the way to convolutional neural networks, evaluation, interpretability, and lightweight deployment.

📌 What’s Inside

PyTorch fundamentals and training loops

Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization

Classical ML vs Neural Network comparisons

CNN-based medical image classification

Performance tuning and evaluation

Model interpretability techniques

Simple local deployment demos

Deep learning theory (manual derivations & backprop)

Large datasets and trained weights are not stored directly in this repo and are linked separately when required.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>


Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebooks:

jupyter notebook

🎯 Goals of This Project

Practice building neural networks from scratch in PyTorch

Understand the full ML workflow: data → model → evaluation

Experiment with CNN architectures and optimization techniques

Learn how to interpret deep models instead of treating them like black boxes

Explore basic deployment pipelines
